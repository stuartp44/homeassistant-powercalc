# Sensor configuration

For each entity you want to create a virtual power sensor for you'll need to add an entry in `configuration.yaml` or use the GUI config flow.
Below you'll find a listing of possible configuration parameters for each sensor.
Not all configuration params listed below are available in the GUI, when you want to use the "advanced" options you need to use YAML configuration.

!!! note

    When you define an option per sensor it will override any [global configuration](global-configuration.md) option

| hide_members                          | boolean  | **Optional** | Hide all group members in HA GUI, only applicable when `create_group` is also defined.                                                                                                                                                                                                              | :material-check: |
| include                               | object   | **Optional** | Use this in combination with `create_group` to automatically include entities from a certain area, group or template. See [include entities](../sensor-types/group/include-entities.md)                                                                                                             |  |
| power_sensor_id                       | string   | **Optional** | Entity id of an existing power sensor. This can be used to let powercalc create energy sensors and utility meters. This will create no virtual power sensor.                                                                                                                                        |  |
| force_energy_sensor_creation          | boolean  | **Optional** | Set this to `true` when you want a new energy sensor to be created for the power sensor with `power_sensor_id`, even if the device already has an energy sensor entity of its own.                                                                                                                  |  |
| force_calculate_group_energy          | boolean  | **Optional** | Set this to `true` when you want to create a Riemann sum sensor for powercalc group. By default the group energy sensor sums all individual energy sensors from member entities.                                                                                                                    |  |
| energy_sensor_id                      | string   | **Optional** | Entity id of an existing energy sensor. Mostly used in conjunction with `power_sensor_id`.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |  |
| ignore_unavailable_state              | boolean  | **Optional** | Set this to `true` when you want the power sensor to display a value (`unavailable_power`, `standby_power` or 0) regardless of whether the source entity is available. The can be useful for example on a TV which state can become unavailable when it is set to off.                              | :material-check: |
| calculation_enabled_condition         | template | **Optional** | The configured power calculation strategy will only be executed when this template results in True, otherwise the power sensor will display 0                                                                                                                                                       | :material-check: |
