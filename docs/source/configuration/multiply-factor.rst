Multiply Factor
===============

This feature allows you to multiply the calculated power.

This can be useful in the following use cases:
- You have a bunch of similar lights which you control as a group and want a single power sensor.
- You are using a LED strip from the LUT models, but you have extended or shortened it.

Let's assume you have a combination of 4 GU10 spots in your ceiling in a light group `light.livingroom_spots`

.. code-block:: yaml

    powercalc:
      sensors:
        - entity_id: light.livingroom_spots
          multiply_factor: 4

This will add the power sensor `sensor.livingroom_spots_power` and the measured power will be multiplied by 4, as the original measurements are for 1 spot.

By default the multiply factor will **NOT** be applied to the standby power, you can set the `multiply_factor_standby` to do this.

.. code-block:: yaml

    powercalc:
      sensors:
        - entity_id: light.livingroom_spots
          multiply_factor: 4
          multiply_factor_standby: true

.. tip::
    a multiply_factor lower than 1 will decrease the power. For example 0.5 will half the power.
