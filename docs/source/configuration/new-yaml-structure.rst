==================
New YAML structure
==================

In Powercalc 1.8.0 the structure of YAML has been changed.
This has been done to stay in line with other HA components and ensure Powercalc keeps working correctly in the future.
The old configuration format will stay working for some time, but I'll remove support in the future. So it's recommended to adopt your configuration. It's a small change.

Old configuration:

.. code-block:: yaml

    sensor:
      - platform: powercalc
        entity_id: light.some_light
        fixed:
          power: 50
      - platform: powercalc
        entity_id: light.other_light
        fixed:
          power: 80

New configuration. Everything should move under the `powercalc->sensors` key, and `platform` needs to be removed.

.. code-block:: yaml

    powercalc:
      sensors:
        - entity_id: light.some_light
          fixed:
            power: 50
        - entity_id: light.other_light
          fixed:
            power: 80

.. note::
    You probably already have a `powercalc:` entry in your configuration for global powercalc configuration. You'll need to add `sensors` under that to prevent duplicating the `powercalc:` key.
    When you use https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/packages/ you can of course have powercalc sensor definitions scattered accross multiple files.
