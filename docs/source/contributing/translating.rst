Translating
===========

You can help by adding missing translations when you are a native speaker.
Or add a complete new language when there is no language file available.

Powercalc uses Crowdin to make contributing easy.

Changing or adding to existing language
---------------------------------------

First register and join the translation project.

- Go to https://crowdin.com
- When you don't have a crowdin account yet, create one.
- Go to the Crowdin project page: https://crowdin.com/project/powercalc
- Click :guilabel:`Join`

Next translate a string.

- Select the language you want to contribute to from the dashboard.
- Click :guilabel:`Translate All`
- Find the string you want to edit, missing translation are marked red.
- Fill in or modify the translation and click :guilabel:`Save`
- Rinse and repeat for other translations.

You are done now.

.. note::
    Powercalc will automatically pull in latest changes in translations every hour and create a Pull Request for that. After that is reviewed by a maintainer if will be included in the next release of Powercalc

Adding new language
-------------------

Create an issue on github requesting a new language.
We will do the necessary work to add the new translation to the integration and Crowdin site.
