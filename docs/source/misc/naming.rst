=============
Sensor Naming
=============

This page described how entities are named by default in Powercalc and the options to change that behaviour.

Default naming convention
-------------------------
Let's assume you have a source sensor `light.patio` with name "Patio".
Powercalc will create the following sensors by default.

- sensor.patio_power (Patio power)
- sensor.patio_energy (Patio energy)

.. note::
    Utility meters will use the energy name as a base and suffix with `_daily`, `_weekly`, `_monthly`

Change suffixes
---------------
To change the default suffixes `_power` and `_energy` you can use the ``power_sensor_naming`` and ``energy_sensor_naming`` options.
The following configuration:

.. code-block:: yaml

    powercalc:
      energy_sensor_naming: "{} kWh consumed"

will create following sensors:

- sensor.patio_power (Patio power)
- sensor.patio_kwh_consumed (Patio kWh consumed)

Friendly naming
---------------
This option allows you to separately change only the name (shown in GUI), it will not have effect on the entity id

.. code-block:: yaml

    powercalc:
      energy_sensor_naming: "{} kwh"
      energy_sensor_friendly_naming: "{} Energy consumed

will create following sensors:

- sensor.patio_kwh (Patio Energy consumed)

Change full name
----------------
You can also change the base sensor name with the ``name`` option

.. code-block:: yaml

    powercalc:
      sensors:
        - entity_id: light.patio
          name: Patio Light

will create:

- sensor.patio_light_power (Patio light power)
- sensor.patio_light_energy (Patio light energy)
