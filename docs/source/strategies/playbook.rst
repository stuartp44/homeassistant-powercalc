Playbook
========

The playbook strategy makes it possible to record power consumption over time and replay that in Home Assistant.
This is useful to implement power sensors for program based devices. For example Washing machines, dishwashers.
You can generate a playbook with the powercalc :doc:`measure tool </contributing/measure>`.

You can setup sensors both with YAML or GUI.
When you use the GUI select :guilabel:`playbook` in the calculation_strategy dropdown.

You must put your playbook in HA config directory and create a subdirectory ``powercalc/playbooks`` there.
So it could look like this:

::

    config
    ├── powercalc
    │   └── playbooks
    │       ├── playbook1.csv
    │       └── playbook2.csv

Configuration options

| autostart     | string | **Optional** |          | key of the playbook which you want to start when HA starts.                              |

+---------------+--------+--------------+----------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Setup a power sensor with playbook support.
The example below will create entity ``sensor.washing_machine_power``

.. code-block:: yaml

    powercalc:
      sensors:
        - entity_id: switch.washing_machine
          playbook:
            playbooks:
              program1: program1.csv
              program2: program2.csv

this will also add the powercalc sensor to your washing machine device.

or when you don't have an entity to bind to, just use dummy and define a name.

.. code-block:: yaml

    powercalc:
      sensors:
        - entity_id: sensor.dummy
          name: Washing machine
          playbook:
            playbooks:
              ...

Example using ``autostart`` and ``repeat`` options:

.. code-block:: yaml

    powercalc:
      sensors:
        - entity_id: sensor.dummy
          name: Refrigerator
          playbook:
            playbooks:
              playbook: refrigerator.csv
          autostart: playbook
          repeat: true

Active playbook based on state trigger
--------------------------------------

To activate a playbook based on a state trigger you can use the ``state_trigger`` option.
This option is a mapping of state -> playbook_id.
When the entity enters the state the playbook will be activated.

.. code-block:: yaml

    powercalc:
      sensors:
        - entity_id: sensor.sonos
          name: Sonos
          playbook:
            playbooks:
              idle: sonos_play/idle.csv
              paused: sonos_play/paused.csv
            state_trigger:
              idle: idle
              paused: paused

Manually executing the playbook
-------------------------------

To start executing a playbook you'll have to utilize HA automations.
Powercalc provides two services which let's you control the playbook execution. ``activate_playbook`` and ``stop_playbook``.
For example to start the playbook when your washing machine enters a specific program use an automation similar as below.

.. code-block:: yaml

    description: "Activate powercalc playbook when Washing machine starts program"
    mode: single
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id:
          - sensor.washing_machine_job_state
        to: program1
    condition: []
    action:
      - service: powercalc.activate_playbook
        data:
          playbook_id: program1
        target:
          entity_id: sensor.waching_machine_power

Playbook structure
------------------

A playbook file must be a CSV file with 2 columns.
- elapsed time in seconds
- power value in W

::

    0.5,70
    2,90
    4,25.5

When running this playbook the power sensor state will go to 70W after 0.5 seconds, 90W after 2 seconds and 25.5W after 4 seconds.
All these timing are relative to the start of the playbook. So when the playbook starts at 18:00:00 the final step will be executed at 18:00:04
